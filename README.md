# Mimic : Client

This is the javascript client for mimic that creates a connection to the desired host, and maintains synchronisation
between them. When in doubt, the server always wins. In addition, the framework is _very_ oppinionated, so it doesn't
attempt to do any browser compatibility hacks. If the browser doesn't implement the spec, it can eat a dick.
